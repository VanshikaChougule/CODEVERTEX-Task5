## Overview of the Project

### Project :
The project is a **Contact Book** application developed in Python. It allows users to manage their contacts by adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting contact information. The application is designed with a simple text-based interface to ensure user-friendly interaction, making it easy for individuals to keep track of important contact details such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses.

### Objective:
The objective of the Contact Book project is to create an intuitive application that enables users to efficiently manage their personal or professional contacts. The key goals are to:
- Allow users to add new contacts with essential details (name, phone number, email, and address).
- Provide an easy way to view a list of all saved contacts.
- Implement a search function to quickly find contacts by name or phone number.
- Enable users to update existing contact details as needed.
- Offer a straightforward method to delete contacts no longer needed.
- Ensure a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction, enhancing the overall user experience in managing contact information.

### Key Activities
-**Adding Contacts**: Users can input contact details including name, phone number, email, and address. The data is stored in a dictionary for easy retrieval and management.
-**Viewing Contact List**: A feature that displays a list of all stored contacts, showing names and corresponding phone numbers. This gives users a quick overview of their saved contacts.
-**Searching for Contacts**: A search function that allows users to look for a contact by name or phone number. The search results display all relevant details for the found contact.
-**Updating Contact Information**: Users can update existing contact information such as phone number, email, or address. This ensures that contact details remain up-to-date.
-**Deleting Contacts**: A function that allows users to remove a contact from the book. This helps users keep their contact list clean and organized.
-**User Interaction via Command Line Interface (CLI)**:A menu-driven CLI where users select actions (add, view, search, update, delete) by entering corresponding options, making interaction intuitive and easy to navigate.
-**Data Storage Using Dictionaries**: Contacts are stored in Python dictionaries with the contact name as the key, and the phone number, email, and address stored as values, ensuring quick access and modification of data.

### Technologies Used:
-**Python**: The primary programming language used to develop the Contact Book application. Python's simplicity and readability make it suitable for building console applications and handling data effectively.
-**Data Structures**: 
**Dictionaries**: Utilized to store contact information, with the contact name as the key and a nested dictionary containing phone number, email, and address as the value. This allows for efficient data management and retrieval.
-**Command Line Interface (CLI)**:The application runs in a text-based command line environment, enabling user interaction through input prompts and output messages, which makes it accessible and easy to use without a graphical interface.
-**Control Structures**:The program employs basic control structures like loops (`while` loop) and conditionals (`if-elif-else` statements) to control the flow of the application and manage user input effectively.
-**User Input Handling**:The `input()` function is used to gather data from users, allowing them to interact with the application by providing necessary information for adding, updating, searching, and deleting contacts.
